## Mod compatibility with Bed Ownership Tools

Bed Ownership Tools patches much of RimWorld's code related to building ownership and Pawn sleeping routines.
Since many other mods also do similar things, some conflicts are unavoidable.

This page lists mods for which support has been added by Bed Ownership Tools.
