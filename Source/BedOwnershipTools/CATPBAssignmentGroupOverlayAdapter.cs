// Cursed subclass definition for purposes of massaging data presented to
// and manipulated by Dialog_AssignBuildingOwner(CompAssignableToPawn)

// Our strategy is to overlay the assignee and ownership trackers associated with
// CompAssignableToPawn and Pawn_Ownership so that a pawn internally owns at most one bed
// at one time, keeping with the game's base implementation.

// Will it work? Does it bite? Who knows?
// update: ðŸ¤®
// update 2: you haven't seen the worst of it (actually it's mostly been moved to CATPBAndPOMethodReplacements)
