    <BedOwnershipTools.EnableCommunalBeds>Enable communal beds</BedOwnershipTools.EnableCommunalBeds>
    <BedOwnershipTools.EnableCommunalBeds_Tooltip>If enabled, beds can be flagged for communal use.\n\nColonists who cannot access an assigned bed will try to sleep in an accessible communal bed with higher priority than the ground. Colonists won't relinquish existing bed assignments when they sleep in a communal bed.</BedOwnershipTools.EnableCommunalBeds_Tooltip>
    <BedOwnershipTools.CommunalBedsSupportOrderedMedicalSleep>Communal beds support ordered medical sleep</BedOwnershipTools.CommunalBedsSupportOrderedMedicalSleep>
    <BedOwnershipTools.CommunalBedsSupportOrderedMedicalSleep_Tooltip>If enabled with the communal bed feature, colonists may be ordered via a right-click action to use a communal bed as a target for medical sleep.\n\n(Note that regardless of this option's setting, communal beds are valid medical sleep locations ranked below medical beds in automatic search priority.)</BedOwnershipTools.CommunalBedsSupportOrderedMedicalSleep_Tooltip>
    <BedOwnershipTools.CommunalBedsAreRelationshipAware>Communal bed selection considers relationships</BedOwnershipTools.CommunalBedsAreRelationshipAware>
    <BedOwnershipTools.CommunalBedsAreRelationshipAware_Tooltip>If enabled, colonists will pick between available communal beds based on relationship status, and gain bedmate-related mood effects from sharing a double bed. Single colonists will prefer single beds. Colonists with partners will prefer double beds and will want to sleep together.\n\nIf disabled, colonists will choose the nearest communal bed and will not gain bedmate-related mood effects on a double bed.\n\n(Note that single or unrelated colonists may share a communal double bed when there aren't enough empty beds).</BedOwnershipTools.CommunalBedsAreRelationshipAware_Tooltip>

    <BedOwnershipTools.EnableBedAssignmentPinning>Enable bed assignment pinning</BedOwnershipTools.EnableBedAssignmentPinning>
    <BedOwnershipTools.EnableBedAssignmentPinning_Tooltip>If enabled, beds can be flagged as having pinned ownership.\n\nWhen a colonist is assigned to such a bed, they will not sleep in another bed if such an action would result in loss of the pinned assignment. Only player action and major story events (death, separation, abduction, etc.) can cause loss of a pinned bed assignment.</BedOwnershipTools.EnableBedAssignmentPinning_Tooltip>
    <BedOwnershipTools.PawnsMaySelfAssignToUnownedPinnedBeds>Colonists may self-assign to vacant spots on pinned beds</BedOwnershipTools.PawnsMaySelfAssignToUnownedPinnedBeds>
    <BedOwnershipTools.PawnsMaySelfAssignToUnownedPinnedBeds_Tooltip>If enabled with the pinnable bed assignment feature, colonists may self-assign to unowned or partner-owned beds flagged as having a pinned owner.\n\nThey would become a pinned owner of such a bed once self-assigned. If disabled, only player action can cause a colonist to gain a pinned bed assignment.</BedOwnershipTools.PawnsMaySelfAssignToUnownedPinnedBeds_Tooltip>

    <BedOwnershipTools.EnableBedAssignmentGroups>Enable multiple bed assignment system</BedOwnershipTools.EnableBedAssignmentGroups>
    <BedOwnershipTools.EnableBedAssignmentGroups_Tooltip>If enabled, allows beds to be categorized by the player into assignment groups.\n\nColonists may own at most one bed in each assignment group. When a colonist is tired, they will try to sleep in the bed of the most prioritized group that they can access. If pinned ownership is enabled, pinning only takes effect only within the beds of a group.\n\nDisabling this toggle will cause inactive bed assignments to be cleared.</BedOwnershipTools.EnableBedAssignmentGroups_Tooltip>

    <BedOwnershipTools.EnableSpareDeathrestBindings>Enable spare deathrest bindings</BedOwnershipTools.EnableSpareDeathrestBindings>
    <BedOwnershipTools.EnableSpareDeathrestBindings_Tooltip>If enabled, deathresters can bind to multiple deathrest caskets and more buildings than supported by their deathrest serum capacity.\n\nWith spare bindings, deathresters can switch between deathrest buildings without needing to deconstruct the previously used set. Deathresters will still be limited by serum capacity while deathresting.</BedOwnershipTools.EnableSpareDeathrestBindings_Tooltip>
    <BedOwnershipTools.DeathrestBindingsArePermanent>Deathrest bindings are permanent</BedOwnershipTools.DeathrestBindingsArePermanent>
    <BedOwnershipTools.DeathrestBindingsArePermanent_Tooltip>If enabled with the spare deathrest bindings feature, retains vanilla game behaviour where deathrest buildings are irreversibly bound to the building's first user.

    <BedOwnershipTools.EnableAutomaticDeathrest>Enable automatic deathrest</BedOwnershipTools.EnableAutomaticDeathrest>
    <BedOwnershipTools.EnableAutomaticDeathrest_Tooltip>If enabled, allows the player to optionally assign automatic deathrest schedules to deathrester colonists.\n\nDeathresters following a schedule will autonomously deathrest on certain calendar dates or at certain exhaustion levels. Deathresters will not automatically deathrest if they do not own a deathrest casket or regular bed.</BedOwnershipTools.EnableAutomaticDeathrest_Tooltip>
    <BedOwnershipTools.IgnoreBedsForAutomaticDeathrest>Ignore beds for automatic deathrest</BedOwnershipTools.IgnoreBedsForAutomaticDeathrest>
    <BedOwnershipTools.IgnoreBedsForAutomaticDeathrest_Tooltip>If enabled with the automatic deathrest feature, deathrester colonists will not use regular beds for automatic deathrest. If disabled, deathrester colonists will consider using regular beds for automatic deathrest if they cannot locate a deathrest casket.\n\nDeathresters will always prioritize using deathrest caskets over beds.</BedOwnershipTools.IgnoreBedsForAutomaticDeathrest_Tooltip>

    <BedOwnershipTools.ShowCommunalGUIOverlayInsteadOfBlankUnderBed>Show "communal" label instead of blank under bed</BedOwnershipTools.ShowCommunalGUIOverlayInsteadOfBlankUnderBed>
    <BedOwnershipTools.ShowCommunalGUIOverlayInsteadOfBlankUnderBed_Tooltip>If enabled with the communal bed feature, vacant communal beds will indicate their owner as "(comm.)" over the bed. If disabled, communal beds will not display anything where "Unowned" would normally be shown.\n\n(Note that regardless of this setting, bed settings can be inspected by clicking on the bed.)</BedOwnershipTools.ShowCommunalGUIOverlayInsteadOfBlankUnderBed_Tooltip>
    <BedOwnershipTools.HideGUIOverlayOnNonHumanlikeBeds>Hide GUI overlay on animal beds</BedOwnershipTools.HideGUIOverlayOnNonHumanlikeBeds>
    <BedOwnershipTools.HideGUIOverlayOnNonHumanlikeBeds_Tooltip>If enabled, animal beds will not show labels over the bed indicating communal, pinned, or assignment group information. Enabling this option will hide communal labels, overriding the "Show 'communal' label instead of blank under bed" option.\n\n(Note that regardless of this setting, bed settings can be inspected by clicking on the bed.)</BedOwnershipTools.HideGUIOverlayOnNonHumanlikeBeds_Tooltip>
    <BedOwnershipTools.ShowColonistsAcrossAllMapsInAssignmentDialog>Show global colony member list while assigning beds</BedOwnershipTools.ShowColonistsAcrossAllMapsInAssignmentDialog>
    <BedOwnershipTools.ShowColonistsAcrossAllMapsInAssignmentDialog_Tooltip>If enabled, bed assignment dialogs will show eligible pawns across all maps, caravans and transporters. If disabled, reverts to vanilla behaviour where only pawns on the bed's map are shown.</BedOwnershipTools.ShowColonistsAcrossAllMapsInAssignmentDialog_Tooltip>
    <BedOwnershipTools.HideDeathrestAutoControlsOnPawnWhileAwake>Hide deathrest auto-controls on pawn while awake</BedOwnershipTools.HideDeathrestAutoControlsOnPawnWhileAwake>
    <BedOwnershipTools.HideDeathrestAutoControlsOnPawnWhileAwake_Tooltip>If enabled, deathrester colonists will only expose deathrest scheduling and auto-wake controls while deathresting. If disabled, always shows deathrest controls when such pawns are selected.</BedOwnershipTools.HideDeathrestAutoControlsOnPawnWhileAwake_Tooltip>
    <BedOwnershipTools.ShowDeathrestAutoControlsOnCasket>Show deathrest auto-controls on deathrest caskets</BedOwnershipTools.ShowDeathrestAutoControlsOnCasket>
    <BedOwnershipTools.ShowDeathrestAutoControlsOnCasket_Tooltip>If enabled, deathrest caskets will expose deathrest scheduling and auto-wake controls associated with their bound pawn. If disabled, only the pawn will expose such settings.</BedOwnershipTools.ShowDeathrestAutoControlsOnCasket_Tooltip>

    <BedOwnershipTools.EnableModCompatPatches>Enable "{0}" support</BedOwnershipTools.EnableModCompatPatches>
    <BedOwnershipTools.EnableModCompatPatches_Tooltip>Enables patching code within another mod, to improve compatibility with this mod. If enabled, only takes effect if that mod is loaded.\n\nThese patches may break with updates from either mod. This toggle allows opt-out from these code patches, as they may not be required for a playable experience.\n\nRimWorld must be restarted for a toggle to take effect.</BedOwnershipTools.EnableModCompatPatches_Tooltip>

    <BedOwnershipTools.DevEnableDebugInspectStringListings>[DEV] Enable debug inspect string listings</BedOwnershipTools.DevEnableDebugInspectStringListings>
    <BedOwnershipTools.DevEnableDebugInspectStringListings_Tooltip>Enables displaying reference identifiers and ownership lists on Building_Beds and Pawns in-game on the inspector panel, to assist with debugging ownership state.</BedOwnershipTools.DevEnableDebugInspectStringListings_Tooltip>
    <BedOwnershipTools.DevEnableUnaccountedCaseLogging>[DEV] Enable unaccounted case logging</BedOwnershipTools.DevEnableUnaccountedCaseLogging>
    <BedOwnershipTools.DevEnableUnaccountedCaseLogging_Tooltip>Enables printing warnings when a pawn is asked to unclaim one of its beds by a caller that is not aware of the multiple bed ownership system. In such cases, without special handling, the pawn would unclaim all its beds.</BedOwnershipTools.DevEnableUnaccountedCaseLogging_Tooltip>
    <BedOwnershipTools.DevEnableExtraMenusAndGizmos>[DEV] Enable extra menus and gizmos</BedOwnershipTools.DevEnableExtraMenusAndGizmos>
